# WebChat

## What does this project aim to achieve?

This project aims to be an easy to use, real-time application that allows users to send messages to one another both individually and in groups. It uses user managment by allowing users to log in and out of the application and storing their information. Conversations are separated into different channels that are onaccessable to users that are in it.

## What languages and tools did I use?

I used React TS/JS for both backend and frontend as well as TailwindCss for styling and Socket. For testing I will be useing  using Jest.

## What will be implemented in the future?

I plan to implement:
- A notification system where channels that have new activity will have a marker on the channel list display
- Prettier UI
